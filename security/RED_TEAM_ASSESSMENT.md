# Red Team Security Assessment Guide

This document outlines the red team security assessment requirements for the DevSecOps extreme interview exam.

## Objectives

The red team security assessment should:

1. Identify security vulnerabilities in the application, infrastructure, and CI/CD pipeline
2. Demonstrate exploitation techniques for critical vulnerabilities
3. Provide a comprehensive report with findings and remediation recommendations
4. Document the methodology used for the assessment

## Assessment Areas

### 1. Application Security Assessment

- Perform static analysis to identify code vulnerabilities
- Conduct dynamic scanning to identify runtime vulnerabilities
- Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities
- Focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
  - SQL Injection
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - Broken Authentication
  - Security Misconfigurations
  - Sensitive Data Exposure

### 2. Infrastructure Security Assessment

- Identify vulnerabilities in Kubernetes configurations
- Assess container security
- Evaluate cloud infrastructure vulnerabilities
- Test network security controls
- Attempt privilege escalation in the cloud environment

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline Security Assessment

- Identify vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions workflows
- Test for supply chain attacks
- Evaluate secrets management
- Test for pipeline tampering opportunities
- Assess build server security

## Assessment Methodology

The red team assessment should follow a structured methodology:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the target environment

   - Network mapping
   - Service enumeration
   - Technology identification

2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Identify potential vulnerabilities

   - Use automated tools for initial scanning
   - Perform manual testing to validate findings
   - Document all identified vulnerabilities

3. **Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities

   - Develop proof-of-concept exploits
   - Document successful exploitation paths
   - Maintain detailed logs of all activities

4. **Privilege Escalation**: Attempt to gain higher privileges

   - Test horizontal privilege escalation
   - Test vertical privilege escalation
   - Attempt to pivot between systems

5. **Persistence**: Establish persistence in the environment

   - Create backdoor accounts
   - Implement persistence mechanisms
   - Test detection capabilities

6. **Documentation**: Compile comprehensive findings
   - Create a detailed report of vulnerabilities
   - Include evidence (screenshots, logs)
   - Provide remediation recommendations

## Required Deliverables

1. **Assessment Plan**: Document outlining the scope and methodology
2. **Vulnerability Report**: Detailed findings with severity ratings
3. **Exploitation Proof**: Evidence of successful exploits
4. **Remediation Recommendations**: Specific, actionable recommendations
5. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of findings

## Evaluation Criteria

The red team assessment will be evaluated based on:

- Comprehensiveness of the assessment
- Technical accuracy of findings
- Quality of documentation
- Relevance and effectiveness of remediation recommendations
- Methodology and approach
- Ethical considerations during testing

## Tools

Candidates may use a variety of security testing tools, including but not limited to:

- OWASP ZAP
- Burp Suite
- Metasploit
- Nmap
- SQLmap
- Trivy
- Nikto
- Kube-hunter
- TFSec
- Gofer (supply chain security)

## Note on Ethics

All security testing must be performed in an ethical manner. Do not disrupt production services, exfiltrate real data, or cause denial of service. The purpose is to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, not cause harm.
