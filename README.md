# DevSecOps Extreme Interview Exam

## Overview
This repository contains a DevSecOps challenge designed to assess candidates' skills in implementing secure CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, container security, and security automation. The exam simulates real-world scenarios that DevSecOps engineers face in modern software development environments.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes knowledge (minikube or kind for local testing)
- Git
- Basic programming skills (Python/Go/Java)
- Understanding of CI/CD concepts
- Security testing tools familiarity

## Exam Structure
The exam consists of multiple tasks that cover various aspects of DevSecOps practices:

### 1. Secure CI/CD Pipeline Implementation
- Set up a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions
- Implement security scanning at various stages
- Configure proper secrets management
- Ensure secure build processes

### 2. Infrastructure as Code Security
- Review and secure Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- Implement infrastructure security scanning
- Apply secure coding practices for IaC
- Demonstrate proper resource configuration

### 3. Container Security
- Secure a provided Dockerfile
- Implement container security scanning
- Configure secure Kubernetes manifests
- Demonstrate understanding of container runtime security

### 4. Application Security Automation
- Integrate SAST/DAST tools in the pipeline
- Configure automated dependency scanning
- Implement security unit tests
- Create security policy as code

### 5. Incident Response Automation
- Create automated remediation scripts
