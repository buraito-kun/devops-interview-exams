# 1. Secure CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Objective

Implement a secure CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that includes proper security scanning, secrets management, and secure build processes.

## Requirements

1. Review and fix the existing GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml`
2. Implement the following security measures:
   - SAST scanning (Static Application Security Testing)
   - DAST scanning (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - Container image scanning
   - Dependencies/SCA scanning
   - Secrets scanning
   - IaC scanning
3. Configure proper secrets management
4. Implement secure build processes
5. Configure approval gates for production deployment
6. Implement proper tagging and versioning

## Expected Deliverables

1. Secure GitHub Actions workflow files
2. Documentation on security measures implemented
3. Evidence of successful pipeline execution with security scanning
4. Explanation of remediation for identified security issues

## Resources

- Current GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yaml`
- Sample application: `/app`
- Infrastructure code: `/infra`
