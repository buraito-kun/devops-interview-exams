4. Demonstrate proper resource configuration
5. Implement least privilege principle for all resources
6. Configure proper encryption and security controls

## Expected Deliverables

1. Secure Terraform configuration
2. Infrastructure security scanning implementation
3. Documentation of security improvements made
4. Evidence of successful security scanning

## Resources

- Terraform templates: `/infra/main.tf`
- Infrastructure security scanning script: `/scripts/iac_security_scan.sh`
- Kubernetes manifests: `/infra/deployment.yaml`
