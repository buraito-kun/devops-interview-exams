# Security Requirements

This document outlines the security requirements that must be addressed as part of the DevSecOps extreme interview exam.

## Application Security Requirements

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
   - Implement proper input validation for all APIs
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement secure authentication mechanisms
   - Use proper password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
   - Implement role-based access control
   - Apply principle of least privilege

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Implement secure handling of credentials
   - No hardcoded secrets in application code
   - Proper session management

4. **Error Handling**
   - Implement secure error handling
   - No leakage of sensitive information in error messages
   - Implement proper logging without sensitive data

## Infrastructure Security Requirements

1. **Cloud Security**
   - Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework security principles
   - Use IAM roles with least privilege
   - Encrypt data at rest and in transit
   - Enable AWS CloudTrail for auditing
   - Implement proper network security with VPCs and security groups

2. **Kubernetes Security**
   - Implement Pod Security Policies
   - Define Network Policies for pod-to-pod communication
   - Use RBAC for access control
   - Set resource limits for all containers
   - Run containers as non-root user
   - Implement securityContext with proper capabilities

3. **Docker Security**
   - Use specific image tags, not "latest"
   - Implement multi-stage builds
   - Minimize image size and attack surface
   - No unnecessary packages or tools
   - No sensitive data in Docker images
   - Set proper user and permissions

## CI/CD Security Requirements

1. **Pipeline Security**
   - Secure credentials management in CI/CD
   - Pin all GitHub Action versions with SHA
   - Implement code signing
   - Separate build and deployment environments
   - Implement approval gates for production deployments

2. **Security Testing**
   - Implement SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
   - Implement SCA (Software Composition Analysis)
   - Implement DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)
   - Implement container security scanning
   - Implement IaC security scanning

## Monitoring and Incident Response

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive logging
   - Set up alerts for security events
   - Implement audit trails for all system changes
   - Monitor for suspicious activities

2. **Incident Response**
   - Define incident response procedures
   - Implement automated remediation for common issues
   - Define escalation paths and responsibilities
   - Document recovery procedures

## Compliance

1. **Compliance Validation**
   - Implement compliance checks in the pipeline
   - Ensure code meets industry standards (OWASP Top 10, CIS Benchmarks)
   - Document compliance with specific regulations if required
   - Generate compliance reports automatically

## Assessment Criteria

The candidate's solution will be assessed based on how well they address these security requirements. The implementation should demonstrate a deep understanding of DevSecOps principles and best practices for securing modern cloud-native applications.
