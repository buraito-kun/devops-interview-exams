## Submission Expectations

For a submission to be considered complete and eligible for scoring, it must include:

1. All required code implementations
2. Security documentation for each section
3. A summary document explaining key design decisions
4. Evidence of testing for each component
5. A self-assessment based on this scoring criteria

Incomplete submissions will be penalized based on the severity of the omissions.

## Technical Interview Component

Candidates with promising submissions will be invited to a technical interview where they will be asked to:

1. Explain their implementation decisions
