# 7. Large-Scale Performance Testing

## Objective

Design and implement a distributed load testing framework, create performance benchmarks and SLOs, implement autoscaling based on performance metrics, develop a chaos engineering framework, and optimize the application for high throughput and low latency.

## Requirements

1. Design and implement a distributed load testing framework
2. Create performance benchmarks and SLOs for the application
3. Implement autoscaling based on performance metrics
4. Develop a chaos engineering framework to test system resilience
5. Optimize the application for high throughput and low latency at scale

## Expected Deliverables

1. Distributed load testing implementation
2. Performance benchmarks and SLOs documentation
3. Autoscaling configuration based on performance
4. Chaos engineering implementation
5. Application optimization for performance
6. Performance testing results and analysis

## Resources

- Load testing script: `/performance/load_test.js`
- Distributed load testing configuration: `/performance/distributed_load_test.yaml`
- Chaos engineering configuration: `/chaos-engineering/chaos_experiment.yaml`
